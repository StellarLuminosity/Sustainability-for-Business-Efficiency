        "The Ukrainian city of Lviv was able to reduce annual energy consumption in its public buildings by about 10 percent and tap water consumption by about 12 percent through a Monitoring and Targeting (M&T) program to control energy and water consumption. This generated an estimated net savings of 9.5 million UAH (US$1.2 million) as of 2010. The M&T program was launched in December 2006 and became fully operational by May 2007. It provided the city management with monthly consumption data for district heating, natural gas, electricity and water in all of the city’s 530 public buildings.  Under the program, utility use is reported and analyzed monthly; targets for monthly utility consumption are determined annually based on historical consumption and negotiations on an adjustment (in cases of foreseeable changes in consumption patterns). Actual consumption is reviewed monthly against the target, with deviations spotted and acted upon immediately and the performance of buildings is communicated to the public through a display campaign.\n",
        "\n",
        "The M&T program achieved significant savings with minimal investment and recurring program costs. These utility bill reductions have been valuable in light of fiscal constraints and increasing energy prices. The program benefited from a crucial initial condition where most of the city’s public buildings were already metered for energy and water consumption and that the city had been collaborating with international aid programs in municipal energy since the late 1990s.\n",
        "\n",
        "Strong city government leadership and commitment were key success factors of Lviv’s public buildings energy and water M&T program. A new Energy Management Unit (EMU) was established within the city administration and resources were mobilized to train all personnel with line responsibility on building utility use in an administrative division, unit, or building. The M&T system established responsibility, created transparency, and enabled informed control of energy and water use in public buildings, laying a solid foundation for sustained improvements in energy and water efficiency.\n",

The standard, locally known as Niedrig Energie Haus (NEH), imposes stringent thermal performance requirements for the building envelope which exceed the existing German federal building regulations by 30 percent.\n",

The benefit-cost ratio to the city was over 6 to 1 and the estimated incremental cost to homeowners was, on average, about €2,600 per house (about 1.4 percent of construction costs). The transformative outcome and positive market reactions encouraged the City Council to propose a passive house standard in the fall of 2010.\n",

        "Tianjin is one of the most successful Chinese cities in compliance enforcement of building energy efficiency codes (BEECs). Results of recent annual national inspections organized by the Ministry of Housing and Urban and Rural Development (MoHURD) indicate that compliance of BEECs in new residential and commercial buildings in Tianjin is close to 100 percent, compared to the 80 percent average across nearly three dozen large cities inspected by MoHURD in 2008. More remarkable is the fact that, in terms of building envelope thermal integrity, the currently enforced residential BEEC in Tianjin (identified as DB29-1-2007) is 30 percent more stringent than what is required by the pertinent national BEEC (identified as JGJ 26-95).\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1997, Tianjin introduced its first mandatory residential BEEC (identified as DB29-1-97), which is equivalent to the requirements of the JGJ 26-95, the national model BEEC for cold climate regions enacted in 1995. DB29-1-97 was enforced from 1998 to 2004. Enforcement actually began on January 1, 2005; it was based on an earlier version which was updated and reenacted on June 1, 2007. This case study covered five years of enforcement of DB29-1-2007, from 2005 to 2009.\n",
        "\n",
        "From 2005 to 2009, about 70 million m2 of new residential buildings were completed in the urban areas of Tianjin. Many were subject to compliance of DB29-1-97 because their construction permits were issued before January 1, 2005. About 50 million m2 of them were designed according to Tianjin’s DB29-1-2007. This puts the upper range (assuming full construction compliance) of the calculated space heating energy savings of these new buildings at about 870 GWh/year, compared with the baseline of complying with DB29-1-97 (or the national JGJ 26-95). Heat energy saved would be sufficient to provide winter space heating for about 200,000 apartments (at 100 m2 each) built to comply with DB29-1-2007. Compared with the baseline, the estimated simple payback period for compliance with DB29-1-2007 based on avoided cost of heating service is less than seven years, attractive even if the energy efficiency (EE) measures have a lifespan of 15 years.\n",

        "Tianjin’s efforts to go beyond national BEEC requirements marked a departure from the mostly central government-driven BEEC regulation of the past in China. Tianjin began piloting residential BEEC in the late 1980s, despite the fact that it has taken about 15 years for Tianjin to achieve a high degree of compliance. Tianjin has demonstrated the importance of the following factors in achieving BEEC compliance: (i) a well-established building construction management system, (ii) standardized and structured procedures for compliance enforcement, (iii) broad-based capacity of the construction trades to meet compliance requirements, including technical skills and availability of parts and materials, (iv) consumers’ ability and willingness to pay for the costs of BEEC compliance, and (v) local government resources, support, and commitment to implementing increasingly stringent BEECs.\n",

In response to rising energy prices, Alcoa embedded energy efficiency into its strategic and sustainability goals, initiating formal efforts as early as 1990. The company's first sustainability targets were published in 1993 and have been updated regularly since. As of 2009, Alcoa set ambitious energy intensity reduction goals—10% for primary operations and 20% for other businesses by 2020, with further reductions targeted for 2030.\n",

        "A key element in Alcoa’s success has been the active involvement of C-suite executives, particularly the CEO and the President of Energy, Rick Bowen.

The President of Energy plays a pivotal role in developing these proposals and guiding their presentation to senior executives.\n",
